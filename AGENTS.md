# AGENTS.md

## Project

Notra is a Bun + Turborepo monorepo. See `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` for
setup, architecture, and the standard workflow; use `package.json` for commands.
Use the Bun and Node versions pinned there, not assumptions about a cloud image.

## Ponytail

Codex, Claude Code, and OpenCode use Ponytail's native plugin; respect its current
mode, including off. See CONTRIBUTING.md for setup. In Amp, for coding tasks,
read and apply `.agents/skills/ponytail/SKILL.md` from the repository root,
defaulting to full unless the user chooses another level or disables Ponytail.
Explicit requirements and this repo's conventions take precedence. Companion
`ponytail-*` skills are available on request.

## Repository-specific guidance

- The dashboard and public website use TanStack Start, Vite, and Nitro, not
  Next.js. Existing `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` environment names are retained for
  compatibility. Read `apps/dashboard/AGENTS.md` before changing the dashboard.
- Dashboard authentication uses WorkOS AuthKit. Local impersonation requires
  `DEV_AUTH_ENABLED=true` and `DEV_AUTH_EMAIL`, and only works on loopback.
  Never enable it when exposing the app through a public tunnel; use WorkOS.
- Run `bun install` before working with Effect when dependencies or
  `.repos/effect` are missing. The existing prepare script bootstraps the source
  checkout and intentionally skips Vercel, CI, and production. Do not add a
  second bootstrap mechanism.
- Use committed migrations for database setup (`bun run db:migrate`). The
  journal starts with `0000_baseline`; do not replace it with schema export/push
  workarounds or rewrite applied migrations. See CONTRIBUTING.md for validation.
- New task environment variables must be declared in `turbo.json#globalEnv`
  because Turbo uses strict environment filtering.
- Use the repository's Ultracite/Oxlint/Oxfmt configuration, not a separate
  style guide. Run `bun run check` and the affected workspaces' tests, type
  checks, and builds as appropriate. Vite builds do not perform type checking.
- The pre-commit hook formats staged supported files and runs Knip. Do not
  overwrite unrelated or partially staged changes to make it pass.
- Never use production credentials or customer data for verification.

# This is NOT the Turborepo you know

Turborepo configuration, task behavior, and CLI commands can vary between installed versions and may differ from your training data. Resolve the `turbo` package from this file's directory or relevant workspace; in monorepos, it may not be visible from the repository root. For example, run `node -p "require.resolve('turbo/package.json')"` from a workspace that depends on `turbo`.

Read `docs/README.md` inside that installed package first, then read the relevant pages from its `docs/` directory before changing Turborepo configuration or commands. Heed deprecation notices. These bundled docs match the installed package version and are available without network access.

This block is written and re-added by `turbo` before repository-scoped commands when an AI agent is detected. In the Turborepo source repository, its template is defined in `crates/turborepo-cli/src/cli/agent_guidance.rs`. Removing the managed block while updates are enabled means a later qualifying invocation will add it again. Set `"agentGuidance": false` in the root `turbo.json` or `turbo.jsonc` to opt out; this does not remove an existing block. Keep the block committed with your work to avoid an uncommitted change on the next agent invocation.
